# Current Account

This program simulates some functions of a current account.

The account functionality allows for: deposits, withdrawals, transfers to other accounts, a printed balance, to see saved payees, and to see a formatted statement.

Please see the [user stories](https://github.com/roryai/current_account/blob/master/current_account/user_stories.md) used to drive the development, the [tests](https://github.com/roryai/current_account/tree/master/current_account/spec) and the [design notes](https://github.com/roryai/current_account/blob/master/current_account/design_notes.md) for details on a couple of design decisions encountered whilst writing this.
